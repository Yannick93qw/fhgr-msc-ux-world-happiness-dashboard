## :warning: Install required Frameworks :warning:

### Backend :see_no_evil:

The backend is written with Python and the awesome `Fast API` :rocket:.
It is good practice to create a `virtual environment` first. In order to do that simply run

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

To acticate the environment run the following code

`Mac OS or Linux`

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.sh
```

`Windows`

```bash
.venv/bin/Activate.ps1
```

In order to install the required python packages simple run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend :heart_eyes_cat:

The Frontend part is written with `NextJs` (a next generation React Framework). In order to install the required dependencies make sure that NodeJs is installed. Install it manually or by using the awesome :sparkles: [NVM Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) :sparkles:.

Then simply run the following commands

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```
