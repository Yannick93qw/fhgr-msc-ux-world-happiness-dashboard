### Backend :guardsman:
The backend is written with Python and the awesome `Fast API` :rocket:.
It is good practice to create a `virtual environment` first. In order to do that simply run
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

To acticate the environment run the following code

`Mac OS or Linux`
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate.sh
```

`Windows`
```bash
.venv/bin/Activate.ps1
```

In order to install the required python packages simple run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
